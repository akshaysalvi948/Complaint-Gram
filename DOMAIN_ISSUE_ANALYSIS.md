# üîç Domain Issue Analysis for raiseyourvoice.co.in

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- **DNS Resolution**: Perfect! All 3 IP addresses resolving correctly
  - 13.228.155.161
  - 54.179.32.193  
  - 18.142.35.241

## ‚ùå What's Not Working
- **HTTPS Redirect**: Domain is not redirecting to your Snowflake app
- **SSL Certificate**: Certificate mismatch (expected - Snowflake's cert is for snowflakecomputing.com)

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Your domain is pointing to Snowflake's load balancer IP addresses, but:
1. **No automatic redirect** to your specific app
2. **SSL certificate mismatch** (Snowflake's cert doesn't match your domain)
3. **404 error** because the load balancer doesn't know which app to serve

### Why This Happens
- Snowflake's load balancer needs to know which specific app to serve
- Direct IP pointing doesn't include the app path
- SSL certificates are domain-specific

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Cloudflare (Recommended)
Cloudflare can handle the redirect properly:

1. **Add domain to Cloudflare**
2. **Set up Page Rules** to redirect to your app
3. **Enable SSL** (Cloudflare will handle certificate)

### Solution 2: Set up Redirect in GoDaddy
If you want to stick with GoDaddy:

1. **Add a redirect record** in GoDaddy DNS
2. **Point to your full Snowflake URL**
3. **Handle SSL separately**

### Solution 3: Use a Proxy Service
Set up a simple proxy that redirects your domain to the Snowflake app.

## üöÄ Quick Fix with Cloudflare

### Step 1: Add Domain to Cloudflare
1. Go to [https://cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
2. Add `raiseyourvoice.co.in`
3. Select Free plan

### Step 2: Update Nameservers in GoDaddy
1. Get Cloudflare nameservers
2. Update in GoDaddy DNS settings

### Step 3: Configure DNS in Cloudflare
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Target: GMOFVVK-QA77419.snowflakecomputing.com
Proxy: ON

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Target: GMOFVVK-QA77419.snowflakecomputing.com
Proxy: ON
```

### Step 4: Set up Page Rules
```
URL: raiseyourvoice.co.in/*
Setting: Forwarding URL (301)
Destination: https://GMOFVVK-QA77419.snowflakecomputing.com/app/TweeterBot

URL: www.raiseyourvoice.co.in/*
Setting: Forwarding URL (301)  
Destination: https://GMOFVVK-QA77419.snowflakecomputing.com/app/TweeterBot
```

## üéØ Expected Result
After Cloudflare setup:
- `https://raiseyourvoice.co.in` ‚Üí redirects to your Snowflake app
- `https://www.raiseyourvoice.co.in` ‚Üí redirects to your Snowflake app
- SSL certificate will work properly
- App will load correctly

## üìä Current Status
- **DNS**: ‚úÖ Working (3 IPs resolving)
- **HTTPS**: ‚ùå Not redirecting to app
- **SSL**: ‚ùå Certificate mismatch
- **App Access**: ‚ùå 404 error

## üîß Next Steps
1. **Set up Cloudflare** (recommended)
2. **Test the redirect**
3. **Verify app functionality**
4. **Share your working domain!**
