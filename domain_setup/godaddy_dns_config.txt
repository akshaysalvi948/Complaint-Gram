## IMPORTANT: GoDaddy doesn't allow CNAME for root domain (@)
## Use A records instead for the root domain

## Step 1: Snowflake IP Addresses (Already Resolved)
# Snowflake uses multiple IP addresses for load balancing:
# Primary IP: 13.228.155.161
# Secondary IP: 54.179.32.193
# Tertiary IP: 18.142.35.241

## Step 2: DNS Records to Add in GoDaddy
