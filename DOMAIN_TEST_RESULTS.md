- **Error**: 404 Not Found

### 2. Domain Redirect Issue
- **Status**: ‚ùå NOT REDIRECTING
- **Problem**: Domain points to Snowflake but doesn't redirect to your app
- **Reason**: App is not accessible, so redirect fails

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Snowflake App Not Deployed
The main problem is that your Snowflake Streamlit app is not accessible. This could be because:

1. **App not deployed** in Snowflake
2. **Wrong app name** in the URL
3. **App permissions** issue
4. **App not published** for public access

### Secondary Issue: Domain Configuration
Once the Snowflake app is working, we need to set up the domain redirect.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions (In Order)

### Step 1: Fix Snowflake App (CRITICAL)
1. **Log into Snowflake**: https://app.snowflake.com
2. **Go to Streamlit Apps**: Apps ‚Üí Streamlit Apps
3. **Check if TweeterBot app exists**
4. **If not, create it**:
   - Upload `streamlit_app.py`
   - Upload `requirements.txt`
   - Deploy the app
5. **If exists, check permissions**:
   - Make sure it's public
   - Check if it's running

### Step 2: Verify App URL
Once deployed, test the correct URL:
- `https://GMOFVVK-QA77419.snowflakecomputing.com/app/TweeterBot`
- Or check the actual URL in Snowflake interface

### Step 3: Set up Domain Redirect
Once the app is working, set up Cloudflare:

1. **Add domain to Cloudflare**
2. **Update nameservers in GoDaddy**
3. **Configure DNS records**:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @
   Target: GMOFVVK-QA77419.snowflakecomputing.com
   Proxy: ON
   ```
4. **Set up Page Rules**:
   ```
   URL: raiseyourvoice.co.in/*
   Setting: Forwarding URL (301)
   Destination: [YOUR_WORKING_SNOWFLAKE_APP_URL]
   ```
